Despite what our well intentioned teachers told us in elementary school, there 
is such a thing as a stupid question. And stupid questions deserve snarky 
answers.

[LetMeBingThatForYou](http://letmebingthatforyou.com/) is for all those people 
that love to bother you with their question rather than simply Bing it 
themselves. While answering such questions in a funny manner, you’re also 
educating those people on how to use search. “Teach a man to fish” as they say.

just something we did for fun.
